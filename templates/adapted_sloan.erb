<% story 	 = Storying::Story.new %>
<% hero 	 = story.hero %>
<% setting = story.setting %>
<% support = story.supporting_character %>

For every time and place, there is a hero. In this case, one with a <%= hero.characteristic %> who is <%= hero.relationship_to_setting %>.

Introduce supporting character (support) with a <%= support.characteristic %>.

support has always been a <%= support.relationship_to_hero %> to <%= hero.personal_pronoun('object') %>.

<% unless support.villain? %>
	<% villain = Storying::SupportingCharacter.new(:story => story, :villain => true) %>

Little does our hero know, <%= hero.possesive_pronoun %> own <%= villain.relationship_to_hero %> who would threaten it all.

<% end %>

With the arrival of <%= story.conflict %>, nothing in <%= setting %> will ever be the same.

Repeat N times: Apply TWIST to hero, support, or villain.
Each iteration: is CONFLICT a MacGuffin? If so: reveal TRUE CONFLICT. Retroactively inject seed of TRUE CONFLICT into introduction of hero, setting, support or villain.

Decide whether hero or villain is victorious.

Apply CONSEQUENCE for hero, support, villain and/or <%= setting %>.
