<% story 	 = Storying::Story.new %>
<% hero 	 = story.hero %>
<% setting = story.setting %>
<% support = story.supporting_character %>

Sometimes there's a <%= hero.gender %> who's perfectly suited for <%= hero.possesive_pronoun %> time and place. For <%= hero.full_name %>, being on top of the world was being a <%= hero.relationship_to_setting %> during the heat wave of <%= (1978..2020).random %>.

<%= support.full_name %>, <%= hero.possesive_pronoun %> <%= support.relationship_to_hero %>, is never far from <%= hero.possesive_pronoun %> side. Ever since that day when <%= hero.name %> noticed <%= support.possesive_pronoun %> <%= support.characteristic %>.

<% if support.villain? %>
But why has <%= support.personal_pronoun %> seemed so distant recently? Could it be the <%= story.conflict %> that threatens them both, or is <%= support.name %> hiding something?
<% else %><% villain = Storying::SupportingCharacter.new(:story => story, :villain => true) %>
Neither of them trust <%= villain.full_name %>, <%= hero.name %>'s <%= villain.relationship_to_hero %>- <%= villain.personal_pronoun %> would do anything for <%= Storying.goals.random %>. One thing is clear: when <%= story.conflict %> hits, nothing in <%= setting %> will ever be the same.
<% end %>
