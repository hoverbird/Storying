  <%= hero.full_name %> is a <%= (17..21).random %> year old <%= hero.job %> whose main stability through an uncertain childhood was <%= hero.possessive_pronoun %> best friend, <%= support.full_name %>, a <%= support.job %> with a <%= support.characteristic %>.

  <%= support.name %>'s <em>other</em> best friend is <%= rival.full_name %>, also a <%= rival.job  %>, but with a flair for attracting women's attention while hiding <%= support.possessive_pronoun %> past. When <%= rival %> moves into <%= support %>'s world, <%= rival.personal_pronoun %> changes the dynamics not only within the band, but within <%= hero %> and <%= support %>'s relationship.

<p>
  The three friends find themselves struggling with love, loss, and secret passions during the turbulent <%= [70, 80, 90].random %>'s.
