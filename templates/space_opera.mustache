<p>Captain {{ hero.full_name }} is about to save the universe... or destroy it.</p>

<p>Aboard {{ hero.possessive_pronoun }} ship <em>{{ ship }}</em>, {{ hero.personal_pronoun }} receives a distress call from {{space_settings.random}}. After {{ num_years }} years, the {{ faction }} have awoken. The survivors report: <em>fleet is huge... with deadly {{space_technologies.random_pop}}... nightmarish {{space_technologies.random_pop}}... but in their zeal for blood and carbon... they have, for just a moment... left their flagship undefended.</em></p>

<p>The <em>{{ ship }}</em> has her target.</p>

<p>But what Captain {{ hero.name }} doesn't know is that {{ hero.possessive_pronoun }} first officer {{ support.name }} 22 is hiding a secret that might end their mission before it begins. {{ support.possessive_pronoun.capitalize }} {{ villain.noun_as_parent }}, the dread pirate {{ villain_name }}, still holds {{ villain.possessive_pronoun }} {{ support.noun_as_child }} in {{ villain.possessive_pronoun }} thrall&mdash;and {{ villain_name }} has plans of {{ villain.possessive_pronoun }} own.</p>

<p>So as the <em>{{ ship }}</em> races the pirate {{ villain.noun_as_ruler }}'s black-hulled <em>{{ evil_ship }}</em> towards the {{ faction}} flagship, the fate of the universe hangs by two threads. The bond between {{ villain.noun_as_parent }} and {{ support.noun_as_child }} will be tested against the one between captain and crew&mdash;and testing them all will be the bottomless hunger of the {{ faction}}.

<p>It's time to fly.</p>
