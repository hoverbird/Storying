  It was once commonly said, *{{ uncanny_philosophy }}*. Total hogwash, of course, and much work has been done by the {{ uncanny_phrases.random_pop }} Society to drive out just this sort of dangerous folk wisdom. Yet, when the uncannies first began to surface, usage of the phrase only increased, and it's now been fully transformed from a truism to something of a dark warning. Uncannies, you see, like serial killers, are particularly adept at appearing as the most normal of folk. Likely for the same reason as your run-of-the-mill murderer as well: because an uncanny may sense at a young age, even before they truly realize what they will become, that they are a grave threat to ordered society.

  This editorial concerns two: {{ support.full_name }}, who by age {{ teen_age }} began having regular dreams of {{ uncanny_skills.random_pop }} and by early adulthood was, in secret and on regular, practicing intermediate management of {{ support.uncanny_gift }}. {{ support.possessive_pronoun.capitalize }} parents had no abilities, and uncanniologists have been unable to confirm any particular talents within two branches of the {{ story.support.last_name }} line.
</p>

<p>
  The second is {{ hero.full_name }}, who would become first order of {{ hero.uncanny_gift }} at age {{ age }}. As is widely known, {{ hero.name }}, perceived no great talent until a near-drowning at age {{ teen_age }}, and within 6 months had, without formal training or learning, fully mastered skills of {{ uncanny_skills.random_pop }} and {{ uncanny_skills.random_pop }}. (And yet, may we not describe the early life of {{ hero.first_name }} as one almost comically devoted to the avoidance of just those situations that often force these abilities to the future)?
</p>

<p>
   Through various circumstances (additional background can be found in the early issues of {{ uncanny_phrases.random_pop }} Monthly), {{ support.first_name }} quickly become the primary {{ support.relationship_to_hero }} to {{ hero.first_name }}, and both gained general infamy in the summer regions. Unbeknownst to the other, both decided privately to seek the glory promised in the first Scroll of the {{ uncanny_phrases.random_pop }}, and followed the solstice map they arrived, within hours of each other, at a now-well-known {{ story.setting }}.
</p>

<p>
  {{ support.first_name }} arrived first, and came upon the Cave of Unmanageable {{ story.magic_element }}, which had destroyed many in quite gruesome ways.

{{# can_handle_element }}
Given {{ support.full_name }} strong mastery of {{ support.uncanny_gift }}, {{ support.personal_pronoun }} did pass through the Cave, gaining the Cloak of {{ uncanny_elements.random_pop }} and losing only one limb, that lay at the Cave's entrance unrotting and alerting all others to the great triumph of the day.
{{/ can_handle_element }}
{{^ can_handle_element }}
  Though {{ support.first_name }} was not blessed with mastery of {{ uncanny_element }}, {{ support.personal_pronoun }} thought {{ support.posessive_pronoun }} general abilities sufficient and pushed forward to a quick and gruesome death, {{ support.posessive_pronoun }} body left at the mouth of the cave as warning.

<p>
  When {{ story.hero.first_name }} came upon the scene, it is said {{ hero.personal_pronoun }} wept for two hours, and bottled the tears to later make the Elixir of {{ uncanny_phrases.random_pop }} that features so prominently in {{ story.full_name }}'s best-selling {{ uncanny_phrases.random_pop }}: An Observers Tale.

{{# can_handle_element }}
With  {{ support.full_name }}'s strong mastery of {{support.uncanny_gift}}, {{ support.personal.pronoun}} stepped past the flesh and cleaned the cave of all remaining {{ uncanny_phrases.random_pop }}, winning the favor of the nearby villagers.
{{/ can_handle_element }}
{{^ can_handle_element }}

  Though {{ support.first_name }} had not the gift of {{ uncanny_element }}, {{ support.possessive_pronoun }} general excellence allowed {{ support.personal_pronoun }} to reclaim the abandoned flesh of {{ support.first_name }}, the use of which would come back to haunt us all in the next age.

<p>
There's much more to tell of this story, but I do think this brief sketch gives a basic introduction for those interested in understanding the complicated relationship between the {{ support.last_name }} and {{ hero.last_name }} families.
