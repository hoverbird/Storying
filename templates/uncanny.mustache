  It was once commonly said, "{{ uncanny_philosophy }}". Total hogwash, of course, and much work has been done by the {{ uncanny_phrases.random_pop }} Society to drive out just this sort of dangerous folk wisdom. Yet, when the uncannies first began to surface, usage of the phrase only increased, and has been since fully transformed from a truism to something of a dark warning.

  <!-- Uncannies, you see, like serial killers, are particularly adept at appearing as the most normal of folk. Likely for the same reason as your run-of-the-mill murderer as well: because an uncanny may sense at a young age, even before they truly realize what they will become, that they are a grave threat to ordered society. -->

  This editorial concerns two: {{ support.full_name }}, who by age {{ teen_age }} began having regular dreams of {{ uncanny_skills.random_pop.downcase }} and by early adulthood was, in secret and on regular, practicing intermediate management of {{ support.uncanny_gift }}. {{ support.possessive_pronoun.capitalize }} parents had no abilities, and uncanniologists have been unable to confirm any further talent within four branches of the {{ story.support.last_name }} line.
</p>

<p>
  The second is {{hero.full_name}}, who would become First Order of {{ hero.uncanny_gift }} at age {{ age }}. As is widely known, {{ hero.name }} demonstrated no great unordinary behavior as a youth. However, a near-drowning at age {{ teen_age }} brought dramatic change, and within 6 months {{ hero.personal_pronoun }} had, without any formal training, nearly fully mastered the skills of {{ uncanny_skills.random_pop }} and {{ uncanny_skills.random_pop }}.

  <!-- And yet, may we not describe the early life of {{ hero.first_name }} as one almost comically devoted to the avoidance of just those situations that often force these abilities to the future)? -->
</p>

<p>
   After schooling, {{ support.first_name }} quickly become the primary {{ support.relationship_to_hero }} to {{ hero.first_name }}, and both gained general infamy throughout the Yellow Regions. Through various circumstances, (additional background can be found in the November issue of {{ uncanny_phrases.random_pop }} Monthly), both decided to independently seek the glory promised in the First Scroll of the {{ uncanny_phrases.random_pop.capitalize }}, and arrived on the solstice at {{ story.setting }} within hours of one another.
</p>

<p>
  {{ support.first_name }} arrived first, and came upon the Cave of Unmanageable {{ uncanny_element }}, which had destroyed many in quite gruesome ways.

{{# support.can_handle_element }}
Given {{ support.full_name }}'s strong mastery of {{ support.uncanny_gift }}, {{ support.personal_pronoun }}  passed through the Cave, gaining the Cloak of {{ uncanny_elements.random_pop }} and losing only one limb, which was left at the Cave's entrance unrotting, a symbol of {{ support.name}}'s great triumph.

{{^ support.can_handle_element }}
  Unfortunately, {{ support.first_name }} was not blessed with mastery of {{ uncanny_element }}, and despite {{ support.possessive_pronoun }} general abilities he met a quick and gruesome death. {{ support.possessive_pronoun.capitalize }} body was left at the mouth of the cave unrotting.

<p>
  When {{ story.hero.first_name }} came upon the mouth of the cave and saw what lay there, it is said {{ hero.personal_pronoun }} wept for two hours. The tears {{ hero.personal_prounoun }} bottled on this day are said to have become a primary ingredient in famous the Elixir of {{ uncanny_phrases.random_pop }} that features so prominently in Dr. {{ last_names.random }}'s best-selling <em>{{ uncanny_phrases.random_pop }}: An Observers Tale</em>.

<p>
{{# hero.can_handle_element }}
As  {{ hero.full_name }} was at the point the leading master of {{hero.uncanny_gift}}, {{ hero.personal_pronoun }} stepped over the flesh and cleared the cave of all {{ uncanny_phrases.random_pop }}, winning much glory and getting {{ success_case }}.
{{/ hero.can_handle_element }}
{{^ hero.can_handle_element }}

  As {{ hero.first_name }} did not have the gift of {{ uncanny_element }}, {{ hero.personal_pronoun }} failed in conquering the cave, and only narrowly escaped. {{ hero.personal_pronoun.capitalize }} did, however, take some flesh of {{ hero.first_name }} from the cave's mouth. The potion brewed with this flesh, of course, aided in the greatest crime of our generation.  For punishment, {{hero.first_name}} was given {{failure_case}}.

There's much more to tell of this story, but I do think this brief sketch gives a basic introduction for those interested in understanding the complicated relationship between the {{ support.last_name }} and {{ hero.last_name }} families.
